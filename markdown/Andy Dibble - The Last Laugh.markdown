title: '[]{#_qbpcgqalhipb .anchor}Andy Dibble - The Last Laugh'
---

A seer, though dismissed as a crackpot by his neighbors, saw God in a
dream. God offered him a boon, and the seer asked to always have the
last laugh. God laughed and vanished. The seer publicly scorned God as a
rude trickster, but his neighbors assured him God delivered as promised.
For it would have hardly suited for Him to respond to a request such as
the seer\'s by nodding gravely and saying, "Thy wish is granted."
