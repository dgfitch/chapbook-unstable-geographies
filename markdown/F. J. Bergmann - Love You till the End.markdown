I'd never seen a more glorious sunset, even after a tornado. Half the
sky was a golden yellow and the clouds above the sun were skeins of
vermilion fire. Even the orange flames on the horizon dulled in
comparison. Dust in the air; much of it probably radioactive.

We had come out of the root cellar, its door fortunately hidden by an
overgrown raspberry patch, where we'd hidden from marauding mobs that
had fled the cities, and hidden again when the pursuing troops began
shelling. Our house and outbuildings were charred skeletons, the animals
gone. We were still holding hands.
