    Is Crappy
---

Bertram intoned the final words of the spell. The change swept over him.

He howled in mingled triumph and pain as his arms deformed into . . .
feathered wings? His jaws became . . . a beak? The howl trailed off into
a coo of dismay.

But all was not yet lost. Bertram fluttered out the window to perch in a
branch, centering himself over the sidewalk, no longer regretting his
indulgence in three Taco Paradisio El Grande burritos. He\'d show Lisa
and her new boyfriend what a were-pigeon could do!
