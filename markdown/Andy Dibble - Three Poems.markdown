1.

Those bipeds

Think themselves

So smart

Huh

Given time

There will be

More dogs

And fewer bicycles

Given time

There will be

Triumph

Of four feet

Not so unimaginable

Society

To piss on

Warmly

2.

calendar trap

no human would follow forever

but bots ungifted with boredom

would not be disinclined

3.

there's no such thing as

hardware just virtual machines

like turtles all the way down
