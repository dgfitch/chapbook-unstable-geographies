After Amazon ran out of everything, we kept layers of curtains drawn,
like cumulonimbus veils, and bolted chainlink over that. We whispered
(even cuss words), wore slippers---noises attracted eaters. They *were*
clowns---probably; they *did* paint their faces. Spicy odors preceded
them, along with incantations that immobilized their prey (us). Wet
cement was an effective barrier, but concrete mix had vanished from
stores. *The Big Deal,* read a huge sign outside Menards, where we'd
trekked to make sure. From inside a floor-model gazebo, a trumpet segued
into "2,000 Light Years from Home," then the flapping of enormous clown
shoes.
