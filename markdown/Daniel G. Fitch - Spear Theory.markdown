If the Earth was always flat, or could become flat one day: on that
great green disk run the dogs of the Great Huntress, howling after their
prey.

She beckons to them with a whistle, then a scream, as the Moon flies a
cold arc across the sky. If they run fast enough through the night, they
will meet it as it crashes to the dirt at dawn.

The Great Huntress recovers during the daytime. And posts on internet
message-boards: "No, you fools, the moon landing was fake! The earth has
always been flat! Someday, I will catch the moon!"
