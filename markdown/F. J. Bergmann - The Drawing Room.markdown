I.

Butterflies drifted through dry air, in the golden light cast by candles
whose reflected flames drowned in walnut-paneled darkness. Arsenic-white
and sulfur-yellow wings stroked her skin like an endless reception line
of doting great-grandmothers feathering a young bride\'s face with
kisses. Where was the portrait she had stepped from?

II.

The mirrors, she remembered---but not like this, clouded with tarnish
and spiderwebs, rippling in their gilt frames, sullen as the stony eyes
of statues. She pulled the draperies aside, diffusing a mist of golden
dust. The windows were mute with frost or something warmer and stranger.

III.

She looked up to find the ceiling absent overhead, open to the cosmos
where she had expected the false cerulean of a painted heaven. Were the
butterflies floating upward now, occasional flashes from a different
spectrum mingling with the pale, winged horde, or were the stars
drifting down?
