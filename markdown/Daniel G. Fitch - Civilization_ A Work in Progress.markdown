**Abstract:** Certain patterns of emergent chaos in large-scale
semi-rational agent interaction give rise to short-lived, anomaly-linked
weak economic equilibria. We describe here a thought experiment covering
a specific range of these semi-stable network-enriched equilibria,
terming this broad category "civilization". We survey the known methods
of stabilization, and go on to discuss possible new failure states and
general improvements to current sub-optimal models.

**Introduction:**

What will they all face

when the end comes in a slow

wave across the now?

**Background:**

When crawling chaos

falls, a cascade effect of

inhumanity.

**Methods:**

Give shelter only

to the deserving few, those

who kept their bootstraps.

**Applications:**

"Property is theft"

is only what the meek say,

having nothing now.

**Discussion:**

I'm sixpence short, and

I can't do anything to help

anyone left alive

**Conclusion:**

I won't try it, you

try to help yourselves, indeed.

You said it mattered.

**References and Supplemental Materials:**

Civilization

lived only as long as we

kept ourselves apart.
