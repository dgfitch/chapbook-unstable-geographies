---

By the time I come back from the rest room, it has begun to snow,
lightly. Small flakes descend out of a black sky, lit by an unseen moon
or the fluorescent tubes behind me. All I can see is night and snow. I
must be lying on my back because the snowflakes are falling directly
into my field of vision, straight down all around me, not a breath of
wind. I can\'t quite catch them on my tongue. It has been snowing for a
while now and there should be quite an accumulation. I start to make an
angel in the drifts beneath the monitor.
