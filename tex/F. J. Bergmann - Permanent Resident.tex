His dream had been to live near water. He had bought the lake house
after forty years of teaching high-school trigonometry, before the
change. Its sewage drained into the lake, grandfathered in, through a
pipe along the bottom.

Just because the muck was thickest close to shore, in the tangle of old
tires and junk, that didn't mean it was safe. He swam slowly, watching
for the sickle-moon glint of a fish's belly. Only bottom-feeders, damn
near poisonous, were left, mostly deformed---like him.

He thought there were new lumps on his face, but the quivering interface
of the lake at night, when he dared surface, was an unreliable mirror.
This winter, when the lake finally froze under thick ice, he would take
the bait and let himself be dragged up into the stifling air.
