\lettrine{H}{o, there!}
Take out your listening-wedges and prop up your pant-fingers
on my opening stoop, children! I say, I have harvested quite a
cutting-tale for you today.

No, this is not grafted from an earlier tall-fruit tale. It is entirely
born a-new! Fresh from my memory-gourd just this morning! Please, just a
few merry-minutes of your captive ears-plenty.

I am \emph{not} scary-weird! What are these ``cops'' which you
entreat-call?

No, no, do not shall-phone the country-captains on my account. I am
scented-human, just like you, children!

Fine, grating-fine, children \ldots I shall return this cutting-tale to my
gourd. Perhaps another tomorrow!
