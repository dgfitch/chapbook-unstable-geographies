As the hand (a devoted opéra bouffe fan) applauded wildly, making an
indescribable noise, it accidentally broke loose from its moorings.
After a futile moment of dithering indecision and utter panic, it
falteringly fluttered out into the sunset (alas, merely painted in
garish grenadine hues on the backdrop), gashing it grievously.
Rebounding from the canvas, it then fell to the icy, rosin-speckled
floor with a muffled thump and heartfelt imprecations, and crawled off
to sulk. Subsequently, it enlivened its miserable existence by caressing
the corn-fed, curvaceous calves of the corps de ballet whenever they
unthinkingly brushed against the moldering velveteen curtains where it
clung.
