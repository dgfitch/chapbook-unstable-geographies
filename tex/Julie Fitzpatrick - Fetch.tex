Changing to human form, Bart, the sorcerer's dog, did his best to walk
on two legs with the same grace he displayed on four. He sniffed every
human he passed. Finally, success! He followed the scent into an
apartment building, pushing the door open before the woman could close
and lock it.

"You're Bart!" she screamed, before he managed to tear out her throat.
Puny, human teeth made his task more difficult. Locating his quarry, he
used his paw---no, hand---to carry his master's grimoire home. Good dog!
Back in his crate, he dreamed of chasing cats.
