\chapstory{F. J. Bergmann}{Self-Preservation}

Zombies retain vestiges of self-preservation; they didn't follow me when
I leaped from the cliff as a last, desperate measure. \emph{I'd rather
die than become a zombie.} Badly injured by the fall, I could only
crawl. Pain-filled hours later, a cabin came into view. Its windows
glowed orange through the dusk; help was near! Muddy, bloody, but with
renewed hope, I dragged myself to my feet and shambled along the fence.
Through my smashed mouth, I called for help but could only moan
indistinctly. The door opened. ``Here comes one of 'em!'' A gun muzzle
poked out, became a zero.
