It's Blue Sky Week. There are weeks for all sorts of things, but blue
sky is important even if the sky isn't actually blue during the week.
It's the principle of the thing. I mean, people break up on Valentine's
Day, get raped during Take Back The Night, disinherit their descendants
on Grandparents' Day. You can wear one of those little loops of sky-blue
ribbon on your lapel to show you care, or a dyed blue (azure) carnation
in your buttonhole. Dressing in sky blue is considered tacky, though.
Protesters pin a cotton ball on their chest like a small brooch, to
represent a cloud.
