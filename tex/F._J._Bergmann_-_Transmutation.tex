\chapstory{F. J. Bergmann}{Transmutation}

\lettrine{O}{ne delusion} that would be disturbing, if I had it, is the idea that
inside any layered surface, any covered object, the thing underneath
constantly changes its identity, unseen. The table, invisible beneath
the tablecloth, takes on a blood-red opalescence, subsequently becomes
checkered malachite and chalcedony, and after that a conservative tweed.
The foam rubber inside the sofa cushions is transformed in sequence to
spun sugar, a cheese souffl√©, wads of small dead birds. The sub-flooring
momentarily becomes solid platinum, then asbestos foam, briefly
materializes as a huge sheet of peanut brittle, and, finally,
radioactive ice. Under my clothes where no one can see, my skin tingles
with flamingo-pink feathers, followed by bird's-eye maple, blued steel,
mercury amalgam, a jaguar's maculate golden pelt; I feel each
transformation trickle across my flesh. Beneath my skull something is
changing to an entirely different substance.
