As the road nears the entrance to an industrial park, the traffic light
turns red, and stays that way. The woman in the car next to mine has one
pudgy arm draped over the steering wheel; with the other hand she is
feeding herself marshmallows, the big ones, as fast as she can, not even
bothering to chew. I can't imagine where she is finding room to put them
all until I look up at the factory smokestack and see them squeeze out,
one after the other, huge cylindrical white puffs. Clearly, no one has
considered the environmental impact.
