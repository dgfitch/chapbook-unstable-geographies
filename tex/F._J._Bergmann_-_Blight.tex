The vaccine was only in the experimental stages, so I thought I'd wait
until it was FDA-approved, with TV commercials and full-page ads in
glossy magazines, but a free, auto-administering sample came in the
mail. I opened it at the kitchen table. The first side effect (which I
persuaded myself wasn't really there) manifested as only slight dullness
filming the shiny new vinyl, then crumbs, crusts, dirty dishes, clots of
hair and dead insects began to accumulate (which I found harder to
ignore, but it's not nice to notice defects so I pretended everything
was just so). Laminate began lifting from the countertop along the edge
of the sink and curling back; the sink itself rusted badly, leaking into
the cabinet below and onto the filthy tile. The enameled finish on the
appliances flaked away and the doors fell off the refrigerator, which
promptly spewed its contents all over the by-now-truly-disgusting floor.
Then, in a spate of utter putrefaction, the oozing cabinets crumbled
completely and the ceiling began to drip and sag downward. Suddenly all
the light fixtures gave way simultaneously and pink fireballs rocketed
from the electrical outlets. We'll never have to go back into that
kitchen again if we eat out for the rest of our lives---if it's not
already too late.
