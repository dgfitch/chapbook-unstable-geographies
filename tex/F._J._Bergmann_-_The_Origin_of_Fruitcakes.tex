Somebody said to plant raisins, that's where fruitcakes come from: bury
them an inch deep and water them with old brandy; but someone else said
no way, fruitcakes have moms just like everything else; you know how
aliens aren't really aliens, they're a cross between humans and
dolphins, that's why they're grey and slimy; well, fruitcakes are from
mating Jell-O salads and leftover pizza with sufficient friction, and
then the man with the bow tie said matter was all the same stuff, that
everything we could touch was cold oatmeal under a glamour. He was
prepared to make an exception for chocolate.
