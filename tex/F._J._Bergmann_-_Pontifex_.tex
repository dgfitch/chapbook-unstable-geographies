An age of justification had begun. Throughout the victory-haunted city,
families unraveled the pink gauze bunting of bygone parades and put it
away in dark corners, with the expressions of people falling out of
love. Artists painted seascapes with the feathers of dead angels and
their own blood. Musicians composed nocturnal rampages for wild bells.
Scientists made final, disastrous rationalizations for the revised
melting point of ice. Magicians sawed coffins in half, then made them
disappear. Bereft mothers with a gift for remote viewing watched from
convulsed shadows as the battalions of heaven marched off to steal the
sun.
