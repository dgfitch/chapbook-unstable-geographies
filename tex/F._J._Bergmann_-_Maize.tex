``Don't let Sally get lost,'' Dad warned Andrew. ``We don't want to have

dragged her, whimpering, into the corn maze. Once in the center, he'd
hide---and scare her until she wet her pants.

the stalks aside to take a shortcut. The opening created the final
stroke in the Sigil of Hastur. Bad luck that Andrew happened to cross
the sacrificial nexus. The fiery blast flattened the corn rows; Sally
ran straight back to her parents.
