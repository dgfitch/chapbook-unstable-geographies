After Amazon ran out of everything, we kept layers of curtains drawn,
like cumulonimbus veils, and bolted chainlink over that. We whispered
(even cuss words), wore slippers---noises attracted eaters. They
\emph{were} clowns---probably; they \emph{did} paint their faces. Spicy
odors preceded them, along with incantations that immobilized their prey
(us). Wet cement was an effective barrier, but concrete mix had vanished
from stores. \emph{The Big Deal,} read a huge sign outside Menards,
where we'd trekked to make sure. From inside a floor-model gazebo, a
trumpet segued into ``2,000 Light Years from Home,'' then the flapping
of enormous clown shoes.
