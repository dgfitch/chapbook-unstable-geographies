\chapstory{F. J. Bergmann}{Multi-tasking}

I want everything on the menu, served simultaneously. Like, now. Yes,
I'm going to wear them all home at once; I like the layered look. I am
reading eight books at the same time: all seven Harry Potters and
\emph{Infinite Jest.} I have fourteen hobbies and three jobs, sort of,
if you count the web-cam thing. My kids were all sets of quintuplets.
I'm succumbing to childhood diseases, the miseries of adolescence,
reproductive troubles, and senility, superimposed with nine more obscure
medical conditions, six of which are STDs with complications, and I'm
taking twelve antibiotics, none of which seem to work. I'm on the Atkins
diet, the low-carb diet, the low-fat diet, the high-fiber diet, the
brown rice diet, the grapefruit diet, and the cider vinegar diet.
Between them, I can pretty much eat anything I want. Whatever you see me
doing is something I'm supposed to be doing, all of the time.
