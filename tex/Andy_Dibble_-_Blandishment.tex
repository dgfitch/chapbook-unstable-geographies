\chapstory{Andy Dibble}{The Blandishment Grass is Overgrown}

\lettrine{I}{ forgot to cut} the grass this week. For most, even most on Hailush, this is not upsetting. But I cut
blandishment grass, and it had already begun to rustle.

"Hai-ay... hai-ay... hai-i."

I fear its rustle could be whispering. I may have to commit murder.

Grown tall enough, blandishment grass is sentient. Although some of our more astute
propagandists contest that is only what it wants us to think.

But I tended to the prairies when we first arrived. I know the name “blandishment grass” is no
metaphor. Indeed, there is no square-cube law for clumped vegetation, so I would think the grass can be a
great deal more than sentient.

It is interesting what a mind considers when all it has to do is cut. There is ample time for
reflection.

"Hai-ay... ay-i... ay-I... ay-hi... I-hi!"

As I listened, weedwhacker in hand, it seemed ever more likely to pass a Turing test.

My job was to beat it back before humanity became the second sentient race on Hailush and ran
afoul of interstellar law (The grass was here first. Even our best propagandists can't spin that brute fact to
our advantage).

"I Hi! I Hi! Hey, I!"

But the conquest of the prairies was wartime, and the megaflora then extended much more than
inchoate greetings. This might be murder, but it might be wartime too. Or time that could be declared
wartime.

That makes it okay.
