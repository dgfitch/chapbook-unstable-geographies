\chapstory{F. J. Bergmann}{Solitude}

If I spent a year trapped in meditation, I would go crazy. They would
put me in a cell by myself and the staff would be afraid to get close to
me. I would claw myself until something ripped open and dance until my
blood spattered the walls; then I'd examine the blotches for hidden
meanings, the Rorschach of the heart. I would kiss and lick the spots
that suggested genitalia, human or otherwise. Love and hate would be my
best friends, and we would all hold hands and scream together. When I
cry out, I feel interactive, like a musical instrument, an Aeolian harp
fingered by invisible winds. My art materials may be crude, but through
these stained walls I teach myself to feel the limits of space. How big
it is. At each corner, another planet begins again, just over the line.
I am bringing the outdoors in; this is a conservatory of the
macrocosmic: potted jungles, hope sprouting like a cutting stabbed into
a trench, an aquarium of salt-water longing with a shark staring through
the glass wishing and wishing it could trade places with you.
