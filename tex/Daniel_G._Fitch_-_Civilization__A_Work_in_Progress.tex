\chapstory{Daniel G. Fitch}{Civilization: A Work in Progress}

\textbf{Abstract:} Certain patterns of emergent chaos in large-scale
semi-rational agent interaction give rise to short-lived, anomaly-linked
weak economic equilibria. We describe here a thought experiment covering
a specific range of these semi-stable network-enriched equilibria,
terming this broad category ``civilization''. We survey the known
methods of stabilization, and go on to discuss possible new failure
states and general improvements to current sub-optimal models.

\textbf{Introduction:}

What will they all face

when the end comes in a slow

wave across the now?

\textbf{Background:}

When crawling chaos

falls, a cascade effect of

inhumanity.

\textbf{Methods:}

Give shelter only

to the deserving few, those

who kept their bootstraps.

\textbf{Applications:}

``Property is theft''

is only what the meek say,

having nothing now.

\textbf{Discussion:}

I'm sixpence short, and

I can't do anything to help

anyone left alive

\textbf{Conclusion:}

I won't try it, you

try to help yourselves, indeed.

You said it mattered.

\textbf{References and Supplemental Materials:}

Civilization

lived only as long as we

kept ourselves apart.
