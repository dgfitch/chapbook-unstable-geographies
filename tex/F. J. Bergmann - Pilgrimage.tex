\emph{You must imagine yourself}

\emph{as a place you will visit}

---Andrea Cohen, ``Details You Must Remember''

In the west of somewhere, a country lane swerving down a long hill that
tilts into the sea. Bracken glows like intricately chased bronze armor
fitted to the contours of a fallen giant. A stag disappears into the
russet landscape as the sun continues its long decline. At a charming
villa we stop for tea, and realize that a mistake has been made when
they serve us spiderkisses---vodka, opium, and India ink. We are
stirred. Fortunately, the ribbons won't stay tied. After we manage to
escape, the sky is purple, cross-hatched with a fur tattoo of clouds
impeding the wheelchair progress of the moon. The road runs next to a
bullet-pocked wall bearing an uncanny resemblance to a negative image of
the constellation Draco, omitting dimmer-than-fifth-magnitude stars. On
the other side of the wall, muted tumult, and the aroma of burnt flesh.
We scream as the wind showers us with red leaves. We speak of returning
every year until we are too old to be made new again, and then turn our
weapons on each other.
