This is the way: don't get old. The complicity of particles. How is an
eagle like an igloo, or how is a parka like a parking lot. Calculators
are the footsoldiers of intelligence. Enough white space on the page
sheds light on the words. The rest of this notebook is suffused with
light to be gradually extinguished. 95\% of us are not reading at any
given moment, and of the 5\% that are, half are not paying atttention.
We have other things to do. Not better things. Things that are or aren't
happening, somewhere in the space-time continuum, out there in our
heads, which are slowly spinning like tiny galaxies. Or was it just the
fever. The healthy ones no longer speak the language of stars.
