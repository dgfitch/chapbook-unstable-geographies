The Vrekli had charged him a small fortune for the gene-tailored
symbiotes, and it had taken weeks for him to get used to the squirming
feeling in his nasal passages, but it was worth it to be at long last
rid of the allergies that had made his life a misery since childhood.
The tiny slime worms reliably devoured every speck of pollen, every
fragment of dust-mite, every molecule of each airborne allergen that had
plagued him in the past, before they could cause the vestige of a
reaction. What he shouldn't have done was to spring for the
recreational-hallucinogen nanobot inhaler on Chur'r. There seemed to be
a struggle for supremacy going on inside his sinuses---some kind of
hierarchical dispute-\/-and even though he was zoned to the gills, he
had now been sneezing nonstop for at least two hours. The spasms were
simultaneously a delightful metaphor for a pervasive sense of oneness
with the universe, and absolutely unbearable.
