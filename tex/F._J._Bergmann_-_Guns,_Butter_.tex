He was buttering the guns again, a Sunday night ritual. He had warmed
the butter in the microwave until it softened just enough to sag
slightly, but when he smeared it on the steel, I could smell butter
melting in a cast-iron skillet, sizzling gently, waiting for a couple of
eggs or prairie oysters. Or mountain oysters. Mountain oysters, now: I
imagine them lurking in the canyons lining narrow clefts in the
sandstone with shoals of ragged shells; wary, feral bivalves crowded
together in unreachable gaps, They would murmur ancient incantations to
their fossil brothers deep in the sedimentary rock. Wherever the shadows
did not move, the stone would still hold the metallic scent of the
ocean's cold memories.
