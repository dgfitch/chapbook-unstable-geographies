I wanted my signature to coil around me, a fainting snake, ascending
lemniscates in gold, the swirled arabesque of welts that a fingernail
idly traces on a lover's skin, a recurved bow with extra strings,
whiplash weave, or maybe something analogous to a grid of bones, a
basket of soft thighs, a tasselled pillow bearing a ballet slipper
filled with hydrofluoric acid, a 1:200 scale model of a coal-burning
utility plant not yet downgraded to meet Clean Air Act standards, a King
James Bible with the naughty bits highlighted in pink marker, a large
duck, wings outspread, chasing a small dog. Someday I'll learn to write
in cursive.
