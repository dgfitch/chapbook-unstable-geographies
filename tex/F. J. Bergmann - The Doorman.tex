That poem was a revelation; it really opened a door. You descend from
the limousine onto the mandatory red carpet. When you approach the
threshold, the poem stands there attentively, gloved hand on the crystal
doorknob, gold braid on its epaulets. It smiles and waves you onward,
with a genial nod. You step through onto the rocky promontory, shading
your eyes with your hand and squinting against the glare. From far
below, you hear the crash of waves, a foghorn, seabirds, lobsters
singing. Out there, something is moving its tremendous flukes.
