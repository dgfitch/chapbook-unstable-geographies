For thousands of years, events occurring in dreams have provided fertile
substance for oracular pronouncements. But here in my own dream, the
sleeping woman in my bed won't wake up, but continues to snore, eyeballs
twitching frenetically beneath her closed lids. I prod her with my
fingernail, then a sharp knife, then it's time for the pincers, but she
sleeps on, snuggled under my expensive goose-down duvet. I soak the
bedskirts in gasoline, and strike the match. She must wake up and tell
me what her dream is, so that my analyst can interpret it.
